        <h1>Neeco's Life</h1>
        <div>I'm a male my mother gave me the name Neeco. When I was younger I got into games and I would beg my mom for games an I would get then 20% of the time. When I got older I started to get into computers and would try my best to look at secrets inside of codes. I didn't know what coding was at the time so I would delete things and just see what would happen. I started to look a the gaming codes I decided to be a game designer. I would try my best to get good gaming ideas and i would get a lot. I was like 7 when I decided to become a game designer and look at codes. When I got older I took a film class like with editing and other things. Then a few years later my mom told me about CodeSpace </p>
